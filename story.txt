In the beginning there was a very tired student. He lived in Sellery and looked a lot like I do. He was up late at night working on his x4 project.
This beautiful man had worked hard all day yet still had work to do on his project. Suddenly, 3 large bears climbed through his window! But fear not, young Kev, for these bears were here to provide some sparkle to your story! The bears and kev worked hard all night to finish his project.
